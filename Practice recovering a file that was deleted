When you want to recover deleted files, things are a little more complicated if you delete them by using git rm instead of by using rm.

To see what happens, try this command:

Bash

Copy
git rm index.html
Again, look for index.html by running ls. You should not see index.html.

Try to recover index.html the same way that you did last time:

Bash

Copy
git checkout -- index.html
This time, Git complains that it knows nothing about index.html. That's because Git not only deleted the file, it recorded the deletion in the index:

Output

Copy
error: pathspec 'index.html' did not match any file(s) known to git.
Unstage the deletion of index.html with the git reset command:

Bash

Copy
git reset HEAD index.html
Check for this output, which confirms it:

Output

Copy
Unstaged changes after reset:
D       index.html
Now, you can recover your file from the index with the command you used before:

Bash

Copy
git checkout -- index.html
git reset unstaged the change, but the file was still deleted, so you had to use checkout to get it back.

Double-check that it worked by running ls.
