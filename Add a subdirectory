Most websites use HTML and CSS style sheets, and the site you're building is no exception. Style sheets typically are stored in a subdirectory, so let's create a subdirectory named CSS and add it to the repo.

Begin by creating a subdirectory named CSS in the project directory:

Bash

Copy
mkdir CSS
Then, do a git status:

Bash

Copy
git status
Why does Git report that there's nothing to commit?

People often are surprised to learn that Git doesn't consider adding an empty directory to be a change. That's because Git tracks only changes to files, not changes to directories.

Sometimes, especially in the initial stages of development, you want to have empty directories as placeholders. A common convention is to create an empty file, often called .git-keep, in a placeholder directory.

Use the following commands to create an empty file with that name in the CSS subdirectory and add the contents of the subdirectory to the index:

Bash

Copy
touch CSS/.git-keep
git add CSS
Follow up by using git status again to check the status of the repo. Confirm that it reports one new file.
