First, try deleting index.html:

Bash

Copy
rm index.html
It might seem like a bad idea, but remember: Git has your back!

Use an ls command to verify that index.html was deleted:

Bash

Copy
ls
You should see the following output. Note that now, there's no index.html file!

Output

Copy
CSS
Let's recover index.html. Use git checkout to bring back index.html:

Bash

Copy
git checkout -- index.html
Use ls again to check the contents of the current directory. Has index.html been restored?

Yes! Now, the output should have an index.html file and a CSS directory:

Output

Copy
CSS  index.html
