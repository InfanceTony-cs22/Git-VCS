Return to the Bob directory, and run the following command to create a branch named add-cat. Use the popular checkout -b option to create the branch and switch to it in a single command.

Bash

Copy
cd ../Bob
git checkout -b add-cat

Download the zip file that contains some website resources. Then, unzip the resource files:

Bash

Copy
wget https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-branch-merge-git/raw/main/git-resources.zip
unzip git-resources.zip

Now, move the bobcat2-317x240.jpg file into Bob's Assets directory. Delete the other files. You'll download the files and use them again later.

Bash

Copy
mv bobcat2-317x240.jpg Assets/bobcat2-317x240.jpg
rm git-resources.zip
rm bombay-cat-180x240.jpg

Next, open the index.html file and replace the line that says "Eventually we will put cat pictures here" with the following line:

HTML

Copy
<img src="Assets/bobcat2-317x240.jpg" />
Save the file, and close the editor.

You've made two changes to Bob's add-cat branch â€” you added one file and modified another. Run git status to double-check your changes:

Bash

Copy
git status

Then, run the following commands to add the new file in the Assets directory to the index and commit all changes:

Bash

Copy
git add .
git commit -a -m "Add picture of Bob's cat"

Bob now does the same action that Alice did earlier. Bob switches back to the main branch, and executes a pull to see if anything has changed:

Bash

Copy
git checkout main
git pull

Check the output. This time, the output indicates that changes have been made to the main branch in the shared repo (the result of Alice's push). It also indicates that the changes pulled from main in the shared repo have been merged with main in Bob's repo:

Output

Copy
remote: Counting objects: 4, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
remote: Total 4 (delta 1), reused 0 (delta 0)
Unpacking objects: 100% (4/4), done.

Next, Bob merges their branch into the main branch so that main in their repo will have their changes and Alice's changes. Then, Bob pushes main on their computer to the main branch in the shared repo:

Bash

Copy
git merge add-cat --no-edit
git push

Bob didn't use the --ff-only flag because they knew that main had changed. A fast-forward only merge would have failed.
