Create a new directory named Shared.git to hold the bare repo:

Bash

Copy
mkdir Shared.git
cd Shared.git

Now, run the following command to create a bare repo in the shared directory:

Bash

Copy
git init --bare

Set the name of the default branch for the new repo. To accomplish this step, you can change the HEAD branch to point at a different branch; in this case, the main branch:

Bash

Copy
git symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/main

Clone the shared repo for Bob
Move up one level from this directory and create a directory for Bob to store his repo:

Bash

Copy
cd ..
mkdir Bob

Clone and configure the repo for Bob:

Bash

Copy
cd Bob
git clone ../Shared.git .
git config user.name Bob
git config user.email bob@contoso.com
git symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/main
